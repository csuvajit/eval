# EvalBot
A simple discord.js eval bot.

# Invite
[Invite Link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=411952600586649602&permissions=0&scope=bot)
Invite at your own risk as its a public bot anyone can mess up your server i'm not responsible for any harm.

# Own Instance
Its more safer to make your own instance however I'm not going in depth in all steps
Simply clone the bot and call `npm i` inside the directory you cloned, and run it with `node index.js` make sure you added your bot token in it, as i said I'm not going in depth tutorial you must already know some basic node and discord bot making.
Good luck.
